  <h4>Muhammad Ali @the Smithsonian : Defining Symbols and Key Events </h4> <br> <br> 
    <p> Nicknamed "The Greatest', Muhammad Ali is widely regarded as one of the most significant and celebrated sports figures of the 20th 
    century. Back then, the boxer was popularly nicknamed “The Greatest,” which his wife then turned into G.O.A.T. (Greatest OF All Time) 
    for publicity in the 1990s. In addition to being cited as the greatest heavyweight boxer of all time, other important developments took 
    place outside the boxing ring. Scroll down to better understand what makes Muhammad Ali so great.
